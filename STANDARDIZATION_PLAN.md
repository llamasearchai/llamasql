# LlamaDB Standardization Plan

This document outlines the plan to standardize the LlamaDB repository according to the organization-wide standardization effort.

## Current Status Assessment

LlamaDB (in the llamasql directory) appears to be a hybrid Python/Rust database implementation with vector search capabilities and MLX acceleration for Apple Silicon. The repository already has several components in place:

- ✅ Modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- ✅ CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Basic documentation structure
- ✅ Contributing guidelines
- ✅ Code of Conduct
- ✅ Development setup scripts

## Required Improvements

1. **Repository Renaming**
   - Clarify the relationship between `llamasql` (directory name) and `llamadb` (package name)
   - Ensure consistent naming in all documentation and code

2. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Convert existing documentation to MkDocs format for consistency with other repositories
   - Create comprehensive API reference documentation
   - Improve example code and tutorials
   - Add architecture documentation explaining the Python/Rust integration

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Increase test coverage
   - Add more comprehensive benchmarks
   - Set up testing for both Python and Rust components

4. **Package Structure**
   - Ensure consistent module structure
   - Finalize API design
   - Clean up any experimental code

5. **Publication Readiness**
   - Ensure PyPI metadata is correct
   - Prepare for publication on crates.io for Rust components if applicable
   - Clean up any placeholder URLs and email addresses

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation Standardization (Estimated: 2 days)

1. Set up MkDocs with Material theme
2. Create comprehensive documentation structure:
   - Getting Started guide
   - User Guide
   - API Reference
   - Development Guide
   - Examples

### Phase 2: Code Quality Improvements (Estimated: 2 days)

1. Verify code quality standards with additional linting
2. Improve type annotations
3. Add docstrings to all public API functions
4. Clean up any experimental or redundant code

### Phase 3: Testing Enhancements (Estimated: 1 day)

1. Add more unit tests to increase coverage
2. Create comprehensive benchmark suite
3. Fix any failing tests

### Phase 4: Publication Preparation (Estimated: 1 day)

1. Finalize package metadata
2. Ensure correct repository URLs and documentation links
3. Test installation from PyPI
4. Complete final review of documentation and code

## Completion Criteria

The LlamaDB standardization will be considered complete when:

1. ✅ All documentation is converted to MkDocs format
2. ✅ API reference is comprehensive and accurate
3. ✅ Test coverage exceeds 80%
4. ✅ All public functions have proper docstrings
5. ✅ CI/CD pipeline passes for all tests
6. ✅ Package can be successfully installed from PyPI
7. ✅ Repository naming is consistent throughout

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Expected Completion |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Documentation Standardization | 2 days | Day 2 |
| Code Quality Improvements | 2 days | Day 4 |
| Testing Enhancements | 1 day | Day 5 |
| Publication Preparation | 1 day | Day 6 |
| Final Review | 1 day | Day 7 |

Total estimated time: 7 days
